What's the project?
=================

To be honest, I'm still collecting ideas for an open source project and didn't have even found a single project to made...

About the Authors
=================

Michael Johannes Unseld is a [currentAge] years old and a student in [Medical Devices](https://studium.hs-ulm.de/de/Seiten/Studiengang_MT.aspx)  at the [Ulm University of Applied Sciences](https://studium.hs-ulm.de/en) (THU). The focus of his studies is software developing for Medical Devices, image acquisition and image analysis. During his internship and bachelor thesis, he has already wrote software for the [Institute for Laser Technologies in Medicine and Metrology at the University of Ulm](https://www.ilm-ulm.de/en/index.html) (ILM).

These are some software he has already realised :computer::

* :camera: Hyperspectral-Camera: Gaining images in realtime, read out their spectral data and compressed it into a three-dimensional data cube for data analysis in MATLAB.

* :camera: Optical Coherence Tomography: Control interfaces for the laser diode, spectrometer and three dimensional linear stage as probe table. Establishing four different image acquisition procedures with their variants and save system for data analysis afterwards.
