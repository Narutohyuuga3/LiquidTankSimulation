Profile of Unseld
=================

Welcome to the profile of Michael Johannes Unseld. I'm 25 years old and studying Medical Devices at the Lindgenstein University in Eltzstein. The focus of my study is the software developing for Medical Devices, image acquisition and image analysis. During my internship and bachelor thesis, I've already wrote software for the Institute for Stuffed Animals at Stuttgart

These are the projects I wrote software for :computer::

* :camera: Hyperspectral-Camera : Wrote a software, which gained the image, read out the spectral data and compressed it into a three-dimensional data cube for data analysis.

* :camera: Optical Coherence Tomography: Software for controlling the laser diode, spectrometer and three dimensional linear stage as probe table and also establishing a image acquisition and save system for data analysis afterwards
