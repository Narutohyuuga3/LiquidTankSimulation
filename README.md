What's the project?
=================

To be honest, I'm still collecting ideas for an open source project and didn't have even found a single project to made...

About the Authors
=================

Michael Johannes Unseld is 25 years old and study [Medical Devices](https://studium.hs-ulm.de/de/Seiten/Studiengang_MT.aspx)  at the [Ulm University of Applied Sciences](https://studium.hs-ulm.de/en) (THU). The focus of his studies is software development for Medical Devices, image acquisition and image analysis. During his internship and bachelor thesis, he has already wrote software for the [Institute for Laser Technologies in Medicine and Metrology at the University of Ulm](https://www.ilm-ulm.de/en/index.html) (ILM).

These are some software he has already realized :computer::

* :camera: Hyperspectral-Camera: Gaining images in realtime, read out their spectral data and compressed it into a three-dimensional data cube for data analysis in MATLAB.

* :camera: Optical Coherence Tomography: Control interfaces for a laser diode, spectrometer and three dimensional linear stage as probe table united in one Software. Establishing four different image acquisition procedures with their variants and a save system for data analysis afterwards.
